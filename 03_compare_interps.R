# Calculate raster statistics for two types of interpolations -------------
# Goal: create a raster interpolation of HIV positivity rates across South Africa
# However, what's the best way to do that?

# 
# Standard way to calculate an interpolated raster in ArcMap is to interpolate
# the positivity rates across each facility using Empirical Bayesian Kriging.
# However, this treats each facility as being equal, when they can wildly differ 
# in terms of the number of people tested at each facility, biasing the raster 
# towards small facilities.
#
# To test if there's a better way, instead of kriging the positivity rate,
# I separately interpolated the number of people testing positive and the total number tested.
# Then calculated the ratio using raster division to get the rate at each pixel.


# ArcMap Processing summary -----------------------------------------------
# 1. Project data to AEA Albers Africa
# 2. Ran EBK with params here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HtItuVG3bbvAB0sRUoKTCeNzysaHGdoglSDfHuI7xUI/edit
    # a. Interpolating PosRat, the positivity rate for each facility
    # b. Interpolating HTSPos, the number of HIV+ patients at each facility
    # c. Interpolating HTSTst, the total number of people tested at each facility.
# 3. Calculated a rate for the new procedure by raster dividing the Pos/Tst interpolations    
# 4. Clipped interpolation to a 40 km buffer around facilities
# 5. For each clipped raster, divided into the SNU1 regions using Raster Split, to get individual rasters per SNU1


# What this script does ---------------------------------------------------
# 1. Loads in each raster piece
# 2. Calculates the average posivity rate for each SNU1
# 3. Compares to the SNU1 average, based on the facility-level data


# Get the real values -----------------------------------------------------
